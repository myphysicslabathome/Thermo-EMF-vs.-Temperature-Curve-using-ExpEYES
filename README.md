# Thermocouple Sensitivity Measurement using ExpEYES and ADS1115

## Overview
This project aims to measure the sensitivity of a thermocouple by analyzing thermo-emf as a function of temperature using ExpEYES, an ADS1115 analog-to-digital converter, and a PT1000 temperature sensor.

Download the "ET_Curve.exe" file and run directly.

## Required Apparatus :

1. ExpEYES latest model (SEELAB 3.0, with I2C expansion bus)
2. Analog to digital converter (ADS1115)
3. Temperature Sensor (PT1000)
4. T/K-type thermocouple 
5. Jumper wires (with alligator clips, optional)
6. Glass beaker (100 ml)
6. Mini Immersion water heater (optional)

# Procedure:

### Experimental Setup

1. **Preparation**: Take 40 ml of hot water (~90Â°C).
2. **Sensor Setup**: Submerge PT1000 and T/K-type thermocouple in hot water.
3. **Connections**:
   - Connect PT1000 between SEN and Ground.
   - Connect ExpEYES (VCC, GND, SCL, SDA) to ADS1115 (VCC, GND, SCL, SDA).
   - Connect thermocouple between A0 of ADS1115 and ground. 
4. **Data Acquisition**:
   - Connect ExpEYES to PC via USB.
   - Run the provided ET_Curve.exe file.
   - Set time interval (20 or 30 sec).
   - Data (time, temperature, thermo-emf) will be saved to "ET.dat".
5. **Graphing**:
   - Plot 2nd and 3rd column
   - Fit Linear to estimate the thermocouple sensitivity (slope) and room temperature (extrapolation)

> ### NOTES :
> - Don't forget to delete the existing data file "ET.dat", if you are running the ET_Curve.exe file multiple times.
> - Reference_data (i.e, "T-type.dat") and graph ("ET Curve.png") for T-type thermocouple are provided.

> ## NOTES :
> - A sample data ('T-type.dat') and the corresponding graph ('ET Curve.png') for the t-type thermocouple are also provided for reference.
> - Please see the 'Experimental Setup.jpeg' and 'Connections for ET Curve.jpeg' images for setup and connection.
